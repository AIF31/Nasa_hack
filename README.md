Challenge: Managing Fire Increasing Community-based Fire Management Opportunities
The solutions given to the challenge compose of the following categories; High impact proposals and feasible proposals.
## High Impact Proposals
Our proposal consists of the use of image recognition obtained by satellite to detect fires using artificial intelligence. After detecting the fire, drones are sent in swarms holding a box of biodegradable nanobots, which are in charge of putting out the fire. The drones will use a vision system capable of locating and identifying fires more precisely to determine the most appropriate place to release them.
In the same way, they will have speakers that will warn nearby populations of the present fires, this since it is taken into account that not all people will have access to the internet and the telegram bot that will be developed to warn the populations of the presence of the fires.
## Feasible Proposals
Our feasible idea takes up many of the ideas of our high-impact proposal, modifying certain characteristics that may not be possible or more complicated to implement, for example, the implementation of nanobots is replaced with CO2 bombs, in the same way, instead of the use of swarms of drones to transport the extinguishing chemical, larger drones would be used instead.
